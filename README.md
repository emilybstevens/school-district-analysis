# PyCitySchools with Pandas
Analyzing school district data via Pandas DataFrames

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the effects of removing potentially dishonest scores on the overall district testing outcomes. 

## Resources
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5
- students_complete.csv
- schools_complete.csv

## Methods
Using a series of Pandas DataFrames, the given school district data was cleaned and the results were analyzed for changes based on score removal. </br></br>
**Example Data Frame Code Set-Up:** 
```
district_summary_df = pd.DataFrame(
          [{"Total Schools": school_count, 
          "Total Students": student_count, 
          "Total Budget": total_budget,
          "Average Math Score": average_math_score, 
          "Average Reading Score": average_reading_score,
          "% Passing Math": passing_math_percentage,
         "% Passing Reading": passing_reading_percentage,
        "% Overall Passing": overall_passing_percentage}])
```
